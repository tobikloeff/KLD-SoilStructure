# KLD-SoilStructure
This repository includes Python code to apply relative entropy, also known as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence,
as an index of soil structure. The code uses the bimodal version of the Kosugi (1996) model to describe the reference 
and structured soil. Furtermore, the scaling factor between praticle- and pore-size is derived from Chang et al. (2019). 

If you use this index, please cite Klöffel et al. (2022).
